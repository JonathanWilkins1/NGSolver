## Nonogram Solver Thesis Project
---

This is a Nonogram puzzle solver written in C# for my thesis project. The solver applies constraint satisfaction by using regular expressions to evaluate constraints. It also uses a priority queue to choose the cell that is most likely to be solvable based on how many other cells in the same row or column have already been solved.
